        "You had to wind the thing up with a key, but you know, it was special.",
        "I mean, I was the only kid on the block who had one.",
        "How long ago was that, Dad?",
        "It was a long time ago. Before there was dirt, all right?",
        "Is that what you're looking for?",
        "-Hey, Kev, look here. Here it is, the engine, huh? -Nice.",
        "They've got steel throttles and valves,",

        "Hello.",

        "Ah, nice to meet you. Call me Earl.",
        "Hey, you like trains, kid?",
        "-Yeah. -Yeah, come on, over here, have a seat.",
        "Take a look at the cockpit.",
        "Cockpit, huh? But you know, this is not what I expected.",
        "I mean, where's all the gears and the throttles and",
        "the levers and the pulleys, ya know?",
        "You know, all the good stuff.",
        "Don't need it anymore.",
        "Everything you need to run my baby is right in there.",
        "-Oh, don't tell me computers? -What, do you got something against them?",
        "Oh, nothing personal,",
        "I just don't like the idea of trusting a couple of transistors",
        "with the safety of a hundred and fifty passengers.",
        "Hey, these babies are foolproof.",
        "Yeah, right.",
        "Come here, let me show you something.",
        "Here it is. Computerized train of the future.",
        "It's electric, Dad.",
        "Oh, it's a diesel, right?",
        "No, your boy is right.",
        "People still call them diesels, but it's an electromotive engine.",
        "All the diesel does back there is power the generators to make electricity.",
        "This is the control center. Come in.",
        "Hang on a sec.",
        "This is Grand Royale. Go ahead, control.",
        "Uh, Grand Royale, we got a hold for you.",
        "Looks like five to ten minutes, max.",
        "Copy that, control. What's the hold?",
        "-Come on. -This is your lucky day, Earl.",
        "The company's hosting a congressional fact-finding,",
        "delegation on your very own train,",
        "and guess what, they're running late.",
        "Yeah, well, it's a wonder they're running at all.",
        "Standing by, control. Ten-four.",
        "I can't believe it.",
        "You've got a global positioning satellite system on the train?",
        "It's the same as on your airplane, nothing but the best.",
        "But a G.P.S. on a train? What for?",
        "I mean, on a plane, you need a reliable navigation system,",
        "but you're hardly going to get lost on the rails.",
        "Ah, it's just so the desk jockeys up in control center",
        "can keep track of all the trains we have out there.",
        "Hey, you guys want something to drink?",
        "Oh, no thanks. We'd better get back. Thanks for the tour.",

        "Gee, honey, what'd you do? Pack your rock collection in here?",
        "-Come on, Ben, I'll take it. -No, it's no problem, I'm fit.",
        "That's not what your doctor says.",
        "I think I'll get a second opinion on that.",

        "Trains, I'd rather fly, it's a lot quicker.",
        "Excuse me, ma'am? You like to fly?",
        "Well, that's a trick question, actually, I'm a pilot.",
        "-Really? -Oh, well, congratulations.",
        "It's about time they put a woman in charge.",

        "And well, on everybody, but especially on you.",
        "All the changes and including Connie.",
        "But we're going to be on this train together, ya know?",
        "And I want you to try to understand her feelings, too.",
        "Yeah, but she's not my mom. She tries to act like it, but she's not.",

        "You see, this particular lounge section is reserved.",
        "And I apologize, but I'm going to have to ask you all to move.",

        "This is your conductor speaking.",
        "You may have noticed that we have experienced a mechanical glitch.",

        "Mr. Reddick,",
        "what do you think? Amps are way out of whack.",
        "It's not right. There's a computer glitch. Have him try manual hard boot.",
        "-That should clear it up. -Grand Royale, this is control.",
        "Hey, Earl, it looks to us like a small computer glitch, that's all.",
        "We'd like you to manually reboot. Over.",
        "Copy that, control.",
        "Rebooting.",

        "-You want a glass of water or something? -I'm fine.",
        "I was just a little shaken, that's all.",
        "Miss, that was that was quite a jolt, did we hit something?",
        "What happened?",
        "It was a little mechanical thing.",
        "I'm sure the engineer's got everything under control.",
        "Sorry about the bumpy start.",
        "-Can I get you something to drink? -Sure.",
        "Water would be fine.",

        "Yeah, hey, give me a double vodka tonic, will you?",
        "Yes, sir, I'll take care of that.",
        "How's she doing?",
        "I think we're going to need some more ice for her head.",
        "I'm going to call ahead to Whittier, make sure they have an EMS team standing by.",
        "I think that's a very good idea, Sandy,",
        "because we're going to be getting off there, too.",
        "So you'd better make sure there's some transportation ready for us.",
        "-But, Senator, you haven't even seen the rest of the... -I've seen enough, Sandy.",
        "I've seen quite enough.",
        "You can't really expect me to support a subsidy for this.",
        "Obviously, this has never happened to us before.",
        "Surely, you're not going to judge us on just one incident.",
        "Incident? You call this an incident?",
        "Let me tell you something. Your company,",
        "it's in a whole lot of trouble.",
        "-Excuse me. -Excuse me. Yes, Sir.",
        "My name is Singer. I used to work with George Bouchard.",
        "-Ah, yes. -That was quite a bump.",
        "Yes, it certainly was.",
        "How are the passengers in the other cars?",
        "Well, there's no major injuries, just a few bumps and bruises.",
        "And what about the train?",
        "Well, the engineer assures me that it's just a glitch.",
        "Well, if there's any way I can be of assistance.",
        "I appreciate that, Mr. Singer.",
        "You know, we'll be arriving at Whittier pretty soon,",
        "perhaps you can help us out then.",
        "-Thanks. -Thank you.",
        "Check out the amps, they're red lining.",
        "The engine should have shut itself down.",
        "Copy that, Earl.",
        "We're checking it out from here. Just hang tight, buddy.",
        "Could it be a cable?",
        "-A loose cable wouldn't give us a red line. -Maybe a fuse then?",
        "A good possibility.",
        "Look, I guess we're going to have to shut the train down until we figure it out.",
        "That delegation already made us lose twenty minutes.",
        "-How long 'till the train pulls into Whittier? -Eighteen minutes.",
        "-Then we wait. -Excuse me, Mr. Reddick, if it's a serious problem,",
        "those eighteen minutes are going to be crucial. We should stop the train now.",
        "All right, brake it and have your pilot check the master fuse.",
        "Grand Royale, this is control. We think it's a master fuse, Earl.",
        "We want you to stop the train where you are,",
        "go out to the main panel and check the fuses.",
        "Over.",
        "Copy that, control. Brake train and check fuses.",
        "Control, this is Grand Royale.",
        "Dynamic brakes are unresponsive, repeat,",
        "dynamic brakes are unresponsive.",
        "The stick is dead, Wilson, I'm not getting anything out of her.",

        "Hold on, I'll put you on speaker.",
        "Dynamic traction brakes are not responding.",
        "Earl, this is Eric Reddick.",
        "You're going to have to use the independent engine air brakes.",
        "We're going too fast for that. It could blow the hoses.",
        "I realize that. So I want you to shut down the main generators.",
        "Let the traction motors kick in, then hit the air brakes.",
        "That's the first thing that I tried, the genies aren't responding, either.",
        "This doesn't make sense.",
        "Something's not right there, Earl.",
        "Do you remember anything odd when you pulled out? Anything at all?",
        "No, nothing. I don't have a clue what's going on.",
        "Okay, double cherry for you.",
        "-Natural soda for you. -Thanks.",
        "What's a five letter word for offspring?",
        "I don't know. Child.",
        "You still worried?",
        "Well, yeah, I'm still worried. It just doesn't feel right to me.",
        "I know. But you talked to the conductor, right?",
        "Oh, I did. But that was quite a jolt...",
        "-I'm just going to use the restroom. -It's not a plane.",
        "I understand it's not a plane.",
        "(GASPS)",

        "Ben! Oh, God!",
        "Get something for his head. Get a jacket...",
        "Ma'am, does your husband have a heart condition, ma'am?",
        "Oh, my God! Ben!",
        "Stay with us. Does he have a heart condition?",
        "-No! I don't know... -What's happening?",
        "I don't know. You have a doctor on board?",
        "-I'll go look. -Okay.",
        "-Is there anything I can do? -His pulse is weak.",
        "Oxygen. You got portable oxygen?",
        "Right, yeah.",
        "-And blankets and maybe a pillow. -Okay.",
        "Is there a doctor on board?",
        "Okay, excuse me. Could you sit down?",
        "-It's okay. Could you sit down, please?",
        "Where's the oxygen?",
        "Coming!",
        "Here, put that on him, okay?",
        "-Okay. -Here we go.",

        "No, no. I want to stay with him, please!",
        "All right.",
        "Okay, hang in there, buddy.",
        "Earl, we need you to go out and check the main fuses.",
        "Yeah.",
        "You guys are right. It's got to, it's got to be the mains.",
        "I'll go check them.",
        "Ben, I'm here.",
        "We've got to get him off this train.",
        "Is he going to be okay?",
        "If he gets help soon, I think so.",
        "My mom got help.",
        "Excuse me, is everything all right?",
        "Well, the house phones don't seem to be working right.",
        "-And we should be slowing for Whittier right about now. -We're speeding up.",
        "Yeah, I'm going to find a phone.",
        "-Sandy. A word with you, please. -Sure.",
        "How's he doing?",
        "He's going to be just fine, as long as we can get him to a hospital pretty soon.",
        "Well, if there's anything that we can do, please let us know.",
        "I appreciate that, Senator, Thank you.",

        "Sure, I just used it.",
        "-Can I borrow it to phone the control tower? -Sure.",
        "-Thank you. Excuse me for a second. -Sure.",
        "Hi, it's Charlie.",
        "Can you tell me what's going on down here?",
        "Charlie, this is Wilson and Eric.",
        "Listen, you've got an electrical problem up front.",
        "The computers are down, and so are the traction brakes.",
        "And right now, your speed is increasing,",
        "two miles an hour every minute.",
        "Earl went out to the panel to check the fuses",
        "and we can't get a hold of him.",

        "-What's wrong? -Plenty.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Excuse me, excuse me, aren't we going kind of fast to be stopping at Whittier?",
        "I'm just checking that out now, ma'am.",
        "Hey!",
        "It's not good, is it?",
        "No! It isn't!",
        "I hate it when I'm right.",
        "We're not slowing down?",
        "We'll have to go out and check those fuses.",
        "I'm coming with you. Can't permit that, sir, it's against regulations.",
        "Oh, don't worry. I won't tell anyone.",
        "No, passengers are not allowed up there, sir.",
        "Watch your step.",
        "Okay.",
        "I hate tunnels!",
        "Excuse me.",

        "Okay, Kevin, go back to the booth and wait for me. I'm going to go up front.",
        "-Me, too. -No, no, no.",
        "Wait here. I'll be right back.",
        "No, I wanna go with you.",
        "Kevin, please, I'm asking you to wait here for me.",

        "-Anything? -No, nothing.",
        "I don't think this thing's working.",
        "-Connie! -Lucky, what's going on? What happened?",
        "The main fuse box blew.",
        "The engineer must've been on the catwalk when it exploded.",
        "He's gone.",
        "-What? -I'm trying to get through to the control center.",
        "But I don't think it's working.",
        "-So who's running the train? -Right now, nobody.",
        "-We're a runaway. -Why can't you?",
        "No, ma'am. I'm not qualified to run one of these computerized trains.",
        "Computers.",
        "We've got to get in touch with George Bouchard.",
        "What about the cell phone? Does it work out here?",
        "I can try.",
        "It's ringing.",
        "Here. I've gotta get back to my passengers.",
        "Excuse me.",
        "Hey, where you going?",
        "What's taking them so long?",
        "Your mom said to stay here.",
        "She's not my mom. She's sort of my step mom.",
        "Step mom's kind of tough on you, hey?",
        "No, not really.",
        "-You've got it pretty good. -Why?",
        "'Cause I didn't get along with mine.",
        "-Anything new? -Yes, they found Earl.",
        "He's dead. This train is officially a runaway.",
        "Mr. Bouchard, I've got Lucky Singer on line one.",
        "I'm going to patch him through.",
        "Yeah, yeah. Just get him on the line.",
        "-I'll go back and check on Kevin. -Okay.",
        "Be careful. Be careful.",
        "-Hey, Lucky. -George.",
        "George, if I remember correctly,",
        "the last time we went on a little airplane trip together,",
        "we relied on computers.",
        "Do you remember what happened that time, George?",
        "Yeah, well, don't remind me.",
        "-Now, listen... -No, you listen.",
        "The next time I see you, George,",
        "we better not be within five hundred miles of a plane, train,",
        "car, bus or anything else with wheels or wings on it.",
        "Do you hear me? Now just tell me how to stop the damn train.",
        "Well, we're working on a couple of scenarios here.",
        "Well, look, just give me some numbers, all right?",
        "Yeah uh, Amp meter, dead.",
        "Oil pressure gauge, dead. Tachometer, dead.",
        "-Manifold pressure... -Dead.",
        "All right, I get the picture. Anything working?",
        "The GPS. How 'bout that?",
        "A navigational system.",
        "Like this train is going to get lost in the woods or something.",
        "Now listen, George, we've got a critically ill person on board.",
        "If we can't stop immediately, we're going to have to airlift him off.",
        "Um, look",
        "Lucky, that's not possible.",
        "I want you to put the map overlay on the GPS.",
        "You see where you are? You're heading up into the mountains.",
        "It's windy, it's forested.",
        "There's no way we're going to get an EMS chopper in there now.",
        "Mr. Bouchard, I think we got something.",
        "Your man has to get into the main generator.",
        "Uh, Lucky, I think we've got this figured out.",
        "This better be good, George.",
        "Yeah, just hang tight, all right?",
        "Okay, gentlemen.",
        "Just take a seat.",
        "Mrs. Hofflund.",
        "-How's he doing? -I don't know.",
        "His pulse is stronger. That's encouraging.",
        "It's a good sign.",
        "Look, we have to get Ben to a hospital.",
        "Why didn't we stop in Whittier?",
        "-When is this train going to stop? -Soon, very soon.",
        "But we have to stop the train. My husband needs to get to a hospital.",
        "Look, Mrs. Hofflund, they're doing everything they can.",
        "There's something wrong, isn't there?",
        "I mean, that's why this train isn't stopping.",
        "Sandy?",
        "Anyway, as far as I can make out, one of the fuses are blown.",
        "That caused a malfunction.",
        "Malfunction? What kind of malfunction? What's going on here?",
        "Senator, please.",
        "We're trying not to scare the other passengers.",
        "Well, I think if there is a malfunction,",
        "we all have a right to know about it.",
        "What we know is we have a problem.",
        "And there's someone on it right now.",
        "Lucky, you're going to have to get into the generator compartment.",
        "Generator compartment.",
        "Lucky, can you hear me? I want you to go down the catwalk.",
        "It should be right in front of you, on the left.",
        "It's an electrical panel box with yellow stripes.",
        "Yeah, yeah, right.",
        "You see it?",
        "No, hang on.",
        "It's like the Fourth of July in here.",
        "Lucky? Lucky, do you see it?",
        "Yeah, yeah,",
        "Danger High Voltage. Right here, black and yellow.",
        "Yeah, that's the one. Just be careful.",
        "Okay, I'm there. You want to run this past me again?",
        "Okay, what we're trying to do is override the computer and brake the train.",
        "The braking system on the train are called dynamic brakes.",
        "They work by reversing the polarity of the electricity to the motors.",
        "Just think of them like the reverse thrusters on a plane.",
        "What I want you to do is manually reverse the two lead wires,",
        "positive to negative. Do you see it?",
        "Oh, oh, and Lucky,",
        "when you open the box, there might be an electrostatic charge.",
        "Thanks for telling me.",
        "-Do you see the lead wires? -I see what's left of them.",
